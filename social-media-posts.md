🚨 SUPREME X NIKE 2026 = 🚀

The most enduring partnership in streetwear just got better.

Here's what's dropping:

📦 SUPREME X NIKE AIR FORCE 1 LOW "MULTI-COLOR"
Two colorways: "Multi-Color-Iguana" and "Multi-Color-Black"
These are going to sell out FAST.

📦 $700 LEATHER JACKET
Summer 2026. Six clothing items. Three colorways each.
$700 is a lot. But it's also Supreme x Jordan.

📦 TRACKSUITS & FLEECE SWEATSUITS
Fall 2026 collection includes matching tracksuits, fleece sweatsuits, and short-sleeve jerseys.

📦 $548 REVERSIBLE FUR SIDELINE JACKET
Because sometimes you need a fur-lined jacket that can go both ways.

This partnership started in 2002. 24 years later, it's still the gold standard.

2/ The Air Force 1s are the crown jewel:

"Multi-Color-Iguana" and "Multi-Color-Black"
Entering a new phase—challenging the visual restraint of previous iterations.

These will sell out in MINUTES.

3/ $700 for a leather jacket?

In Supreme world, that's almost reasonable.
Limited edition + designer collaboration = justify the price tag.

Summer 2026. Six clothing items. Three colorways each.

💼 THE TELFAR STORY 💼

In 2017, Telfar Clemens won the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund. In 2020 and 2021, he won the CFDA Fashion Award for American Accessories Designer of the Year.

Not bad for a kid from Queens who was told luxury wasn't for people like him.

Today, his shopping bag—the "Bushwick Birkin"—has become one of the most coveted accessories in the world. And it's changed what luxury means.

Here's the wildest part:

📈 TELFAR BAGS SELL FOR 228% OF RETAIL ON RESALE.

That's more than Hermès. More than Chanel. More than Louis Vuitton.

And the bags retail at just $150-$257.

How does that happen?

2/ Here's the insane math:

📦 Retail: $150-$257
📈 Resale: Up to 228% of retail

That's more than Hermès. More than Chanel. More than Louis Vuitton.

And anyone can buy one (if they can get one).

That's the Telfar difference.

3/ But it's not just about bags.

Telfar launched genderless denim in 2024. Unisex designs. $110-$240.

He's not just making accessories. He's building a world where luxury is for everyone.
