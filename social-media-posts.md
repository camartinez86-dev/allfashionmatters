📅 THE TRENDS ARE HERE.

Spring/Summer 2026 is shaping up to be one of the most eclectic, exciting fashion seasons in years.

Here's your complete guide to the trends that will define the season:

01. CLEVER LAYERING
Transitional pieces that work from winter into spring. Lightweight jackets over dresses, vests over tees.

02. SPORTY SILHOUETTES
Athleisure continues its evolution. Track pants and nylon jackets are now fully integrated into "real" fashion.

03. CAROLYN BESSETTE ENERGY
The iconic minimalist is inspiring a return to understated elegance. Clean lines, neutral palettes.

04. LINGERIE-INSPIRED
Bras as tops, corset details, silk slip dresses. Your underwear is now outerwear.

05. 80s GEOMETRIC
Bold shapes, angular silhouettes—but modernized for 2026.

06. 90s STAPLES
Slip dresses, minimal denim, "heroin chic" minimalism are back.
