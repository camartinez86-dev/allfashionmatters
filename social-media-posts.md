## POST 1: KidSuper - The People's Runway

═══ ✨ KIDSUPER'S PEOPLE'S RUNWAY ✨ ═══

Instead of showcasing his own collection at NYFW, @KidSuper founder Colm Dillane gave his runway slot to 5 emerging Brooklyn designers. 

Here's why that matters 👇

The fashion industry has a gatekeeping problem. Dillane just kicked the door down.

For The People's Runway, he partnered with Brooklyn Borough Hall to platform:
▫️ Kent Anthony
▫️ Shriya Myneni  
▫️ Rojin Jung
▫️ Ahmirii Johnson
▫️ Daveed Baptiste

Each brought their distinct POV to the CFDA calendar—because talent isn't about who's already famous.

The message? Fashion can be a community, not a competition.

🚨 NYFW just got a lot more interesting.

KidSuper's Colm Dillane—the guy who could have shown his own collection at New York Fashion Week—did something radical instead.

He gave his runway time to five emerging Brooklyn designers.

Called "The People's Runway," the show prioritized community over commerce and mentorship over marketability. And in doing so, Dillane may have just previewed the future of fashion.

The five designers showcased were:
• Kent Anthony (boxy jackets, classical references with Brooklyn energy)
• Shriya Myneni (identity exploration through design)
• Rojin Jung, Ahmirii Johnson & Daveed Baptiste

In an industry often criticized for exclusivity and gatekeeping, this was a reminder of what fashion could be: a collaborative ecosystem rather than a competitive hierarchy.

2/ The five designers:
• Kent Anthony
• Shriya Myneni
• Rojin Jung
• Ahmirii Johnson
• Daveed Baptiste

Each got a real NYFW moment. Real runway. Real spotlight.

No influencers. No brand activations. Just talent.

3/ Dillane is now Brooklyn's first Arts Ambassador. He used that platform to open doors for voices that don't usually get heard on the CFDA calendar.

"This isn't about me—it's about the next generation."

That's fashion leadership in 2026. 👏

4/ The lesson? The future of fashion isn't about single visionary geniuses.

It's about communities, ecosystems, and designers who understand that lifting others doesn't diminish your own light.

## POST 2: Quiet Luxury in 2026

### Instagram Caption
═══ 💼 QUIET LUXURY 2026 💼 ═══

The loudest trend in fashion is silence.

Loro Piana, The Row, and the whisper economy are taking over luxury—and the numbers are shocking 📊

• Loro Piana pieces retain 70-85% resale value
• Outperforming Hermès, Chanel, Louis Vuitton
• $3,000 coat > $300 fast fashion (math checks out)

Why? Because post-influencer fatigue is real. People are tired of fashion as performance.

Quiet luxury = fashion as experience. The garment itself becomes the statement, not the branding.

💰 The most exclusive trend in 2026 fashion? You can't see it.

Welcome to the whisper economy—where quiet luxury is officially winning.

Loro Piana pieces now retain 70-85% of their original price. That's more than Hermès. More than Chanel. More than Louis Vuitton.

Here's what's driving this:

1. Post-Influencer Fatigue
After years of logomania and influencer-driven consumption, there's genuine fatigue. Quiet luxury represents fashion as experience—the garment itself becomes the statement.

2. Wealth Discretionary Cycle
Real wealth doesn't need to announce itself. Quiet luxury signals sophistication—you know quality when you see it.

3. Sustainability
Quiet luxury brands prioritize quality over quantity. Pieces are designed to last decades.

And here's the fun twist: Telfar (the "Bushwick Birkin") is part of this conversation too. Up to 228% resale value retention at $150-$257 price points. It's quiet luxury for the streetwear generation.
