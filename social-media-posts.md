💐 PHARRELL IS BLOOMING.

Louis Vuitton Men's Spring 2026 capsule collection just dropped and it's everything.

Here's what's happening:

🌸 BLOOMING MONOGRAM - The iconic LV pattern, reimagined through a floral lens

🔍 LV FLOWER X-RAY - Almost like seeing the internal structure of a bloom. Playful, technical, genius.

👔 + 🎽 HYBRID WARDROBE - Tailoring meets sportswear. Because why choose?

And that's not all. The FW26 show featured a full house built with NOT A HOTEL called "HOMEWORK"—models walking through a glass-walled home as if it was their actual life.

Pharrell isn't just designing clothes. He's building worlds.

🧵 1/ Pharrell Williams just reimagThe SSined Louis Vuitton.

26 collection features:
• Blooming Monogram
• LV Flower X-Ray
• Tailoring + Sportswear hybrid

This is incredible. 🧵

— All Fashion Matters (@allfashionmatters)

2/ The Blooming Monogram is genius:

Flowers blooming outward from the iconic LV. Recognizable but revolutionary. A visual metaphor for growth and renewal.

And the X-Ray treatment takes it to another dimension.

— All Fashion Matters (@allfashionmatters)

3/ But the real story is the philosophy:

"We bridge traditional tailoring and sportswear."

Pharrell isn't choosing sides. He's creating a new one entirely.

This is what streetwear-meets-luxury looks like when done right.

— All Fashion Matters (@allfashionmatters)

4/ Plus: The FW26 "HOMEWORK" show featured a full house built with NOT A HOTEL.

Fashion as lifestyle. Fashion as living.
