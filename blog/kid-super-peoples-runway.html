# Kid Super and The People's Runway: How Colm Dillane Is Redefining NYFW

When Colm Dillane founded Kid Super in his Brooklyn apartment back in 2015, he had a simple mission: make clothes that actually meant something. No pretension, no exclusionary pricing, just authentic design rooted in skate culture and streetwear authenticity.

Fast forward to 2026, and Kid Super has become one of the most influential labels bridging the gap between underground street culture and high fashion. But rather than resting on his laurels, Dillane is doing something unprecedented — he's giving back to the next generation.

## The People's Runway Revolution

In partnership with Brooklyn Borough Hall, Colm Dillane has launched **The People's Runway** — a groundbreaking initiative showcasing five emerging designers during New York Fashion Week Spring 2026.

This isn't your typical runway show. The People's Runway is about **elevating emerging voices over self-promotion**, creating a platform where new talent gets the spotlight they deserve.

> "Fashion week has become about the brands, not the designers," Dillane stated at the announcement. "We're flipping that script. This is about the people — the creators who are actually pushing culture forward."

### Featured Emerging Designers

**Kent Anthony** brings boxy jackets with classical references mixed with unmistakable Brooklyn energy. His work explores the intersection of traditional tailoring and urban street sensibility.

**Shriya Myneni** uses fashion as a canvas for identity exploration, creating pieces that challenge conventional boundaries while remaining deeply personal.

**Rojin Jung** represents the next wave of Korean-American design, blending heritage techniques with contemporary streetwear aesthetics.

**Ahmirii Johnson** brings a fresh perspective on sports-inspired fashion, creating wearable pieces that bridge athletic functionality and high fashion.

**Daveed Baptiste** closes the showcase with bold, expressive designs that challenge viewers to reconsider their perceptions of luxury.

## From Kid Super Origins to Paris Presentation

Dillane's journey hasn't been conventional. After launching Kid Super in 2015, the brand gained traction through authentic connections with the skate community and underground hip-hop scene. Pieces featured bold graphics, irreverent humor, and a distinctly New York point of view.

The breakthrough came when Kid Super caught the attention of influential stylists and editors who appreciated the brand's unapologetic authenticity. By 2024, Kid Super was showing at Paris Men's Fashion Week (June 2025), presenting a collection that balanced the brand's streetwear roots with elevated tailoring.

This duality — maintaining underground credibility while achieving mainstream recognition — is what makes Dillane's approach so refreshing in an industry often obsessed with exclusivity.

## The Philosophy of "Simplexity"

Dillane describes his design approach as "simplexity" — the idea that truly simple design is actually quite complex to achieve. Every piece from Kid Super goes through numerous iterations before reaching its final form, stripped down to only the essential elements.

This philosophy extends to his mentorship approach with emerging designers. Rather than imposing his aesthetic, Dillane provides resources, connections, and guidance while allowing each designer's unique voice to shine through.

## Why This Matters for Fashion's Future

The People's Runway represents a potential paradigm shift in how fashion weeks operate. By creating an alternative platform that prioritizes emerging talent over established brand names, Dillane is challenging the industry to reconsider its priorities.

For emerging designers, access to New York Fashion Week has traditionally been gatekept by powerful fashion houses and wealthy benefactors. The People's Runway tears down these barriers, creating opportunities based purely on talent and vision.

## How to Support Emerging Designers

- **Attend their shows** during Fashion Week
- **Buy archival pieces** from resale markets like eBay, where Kid Super and similar emerging brand pieces often appreciate in value

## The Bigger Picture

What Colm Dillane is doing with The People's Runway extends beyond a single fashion show. He's building infrastructure for a more inclusive fashion ecosystem — one where success isn't determined by wealth or connections, but by genuine creativity and vision.

As the fashion industry continues to grapple with questions of sustainability, diversity, and accessibility, initiatives like The People's Runway point toward a more equitable future.

The question now is: will other influential designers and brands follow Dillane's lead?
