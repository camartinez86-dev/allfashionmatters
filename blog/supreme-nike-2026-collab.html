        <p>NEW YORK — When Supreme and Nike first teamed up, it was revolutionary. That was in 2002. Fast forward to 2026, and the partnership is still going strong—stronger, even, with some of the most anticipated drops of the year on the horizon.</p>

        <p>From the return of the Air Force 1 to a $700 leather jacket that has everyone talking, here's your complete guide to Supreme x Nike in 2026.</p>

            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Air Force 1: The Crown Jewel</h2>

        <p>The Supreme x Nike Air Force 1 Low "Multi-Color" is perhaps the most anticipated release of the year. Two colorways are rumored: "Multi-Color-Iguana" and "Multi-Color-Black."</p>

        <p>These aren't your grandmother's AF1s. The collaboration is "poised to enter a new phase—one that challenges the visual restraint that defined its previous iterations." Translation: expect bold, expect loud, expect to need them.</p>

        <p>The Air Force 1 has been a Supreme staple since their first collaboration in 2002. The silhouette is iconic, the partnership is legendary, and each drop is guaranteed to sell out in minutes.</p>

        <h2>The $700 Leather Jacket</h2>

        <p>Perhaps the most talked-about piece is the $700 leather jacket from the Summer 2026 Supreme x Jordan collection. Six clothing items, each offered in three colorways.</p>

        <p>$700 is a lot for a jacket. But when it's Supreme x Jordan, with the heritage and the hype, it's also... somehow reasonable? In the world of Supreme, limited edition + designer collaboration = justify the price tag.</p>

        <p>We'll see if the leather jacket becomes a grail item or a tough sell. Either way, it's generating conversation—which is really the point.</p>

        <div class="collab-history">
            <h3>📜 The Collab History</h3>
            <p><strong>2002:</strong> First Supreme x Nike collaboration</p>
            <p><strong>2013-2020:</strong> The SB Dunk era—some of the most coveted sneakers ever made</p>
            <p><strong>2020:</strong> Supreme x Nike Air Force 1 "World Famous"</p>
            <p><strong>2026:</strong> Multi-Color AF1, tracksuits, $700 leather jacket</p>
            <p><strong>24+ years:</strong> One of streetwear's most enduring partnerships</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Why This Partnership Matters</h2>

        <p>Here's the thing about Supreme x Nike: it's not just about products. It's about history. It's about the partnership that helped legitimize streetwear as a force in fashion.</p>

        <p>When Supreme teams up with Nike, they're not just releasing products. They're continuing a legacy. They're adding chapters to a story that started in 2002 and shows no signs of ending.</p>

        <p>And in 2026, with the streetwear-luxury merger complete, that legacy feels more relevant than ever. Supreme isn't just a brand anymore—it's a cultural institution. And Nike is proud to be its longest-running collaborator.</p>

        <h2>How to Cop</h2>

        <p>Let's be real: getting Supreme x Nike releases is brutally difficult. Here's your game plan:</p>

        <p><strong>Supreme.com:</strong> The primary drop location. Be online at drop time.</p>
        <p><strong>Nike SNKRS:</strong> For sneaker releases.</p>
        <p><strong>Supreme Stores:</strong> If you're in NYC, LA, or other store locations, lines start early.</p>
        <p><strong>Resale:</strong> Be prepared to pay premium. These will sell out instantly.</p>

        <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

        <p>Supreme x Nike in 2026 is about pushing boundaries while honoring legacy. The $700 leather jacket, the Multi-Color Air Force 1s, the tracksuits—these aren't just products. They're statements.</p>

        <p>24 years into this partnership, and there's still magic. That's rare. That's special. That's why we keep coming back.</p>

        <p>Set your alerts. Know your drop dates. And may the Supreme gods be in your favor.</p>
