        <p class="text-gray-600 mb-8">From London Fashion Week runways to street style, leather jackets are dominating 2026. Here's how to wear the season's hottest trend.</p>
        
        <div class="prose max-w-none">
            <p>After years of quiet luxury and minimalism taking over our closets, fashion is swinging back to bold self-expression. And nothing says "I'm here and I'm stylish" quite like a statement leather jacket. <strong>Leather jackets are back in a big way for 2026</strong> — and this isn't your average basic outerwear.</p>
            
            <p>From the runways of London Fashion Week Fall/Winter 2026 to the streets of New York and Paris, shorter leather jackets are commanding attention. Whether in classic black, bold burgundy, or even playful pastels, the leather jacket has evolved from wardrobe staple to must-have statement piece.</p>
            
            <h2>Why Leather Jackets Are Dominating 2026</h2>
            
            <h3>1. The "It Girl" Essential</h3>
            <p>According to ELLE's street style reports from London Fashion Week, leather jackets have become the go-to piece for fashion's most influential voices. "From chic leather jackets for the It girl to dramatic animal print pieces that command attention," the trend is undeniable.</p>
            
            <h3>2. Elevated Designs</h3>
            <p>Who What Wear reports that the leather jacket trend has been "elevated" for 2026 — think sculpted funnel necks, premium materials, and unexpected details. Designers are reimagining the classic biker jacket with dramatic gigot sleeves and modern silhouettes.</p>
            
            <h3>3. Color is King</h3>
            <p>While black leather remains timeless, 2026 is all about colored leather. Think rich burgundy, deep oxblood, and even soft pastels. As noted by Woman & Home, "Leather was one of the biggest spring/summer fashion trends for 2026, particularly in coloured versions."</p>

            <h3>With Dresses</h3>
            <p>Layer a leather jacket over a slip dress for an effortlessly cool vibe. Victoria Beckham and other designers showcased this combination for Spring/Summer 2026.</p>

            <h2>Investment vs. Fast Fashion</h2>
            
            <p>A quality leather jacket is an investment. According to GQ's guide to the best leather jackets for men in 2026, "The leather jacket is an iconic menswear piece that oozes attitude and cool. It's also one of the most expensive investments you will make — so it pays to get it right."</p>
            
            <p>However, if you're not ready to splurge, faux leather options have come a long way in terms of quality and appearance. From high-street brands to vintage shops, there are options for every budget.</p>
            
            <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
            
            <p><strong>Leather jackets are no longer just a wardrobe basic — they're the statement piece of 2026.</strong> Whether you opt for a classic black biker jacket or a bold burgundy bomber, now is the time to invest in this timeless piece.</p>
            
            <p>From London Fashion Week to everyday street style, the leather jacket is proving it's here to stay. As trends continue to evolve toward bold self-expression, the leather jacket remains the perfect blend of edge and elegance.</p>
            
            <p><em>Ready to shop the trend? Start with a classic black option if you're new to leather jackets, then branch out into bold colors as you build your collection.</em></p>
