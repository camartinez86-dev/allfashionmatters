        <h1>KidSuper and The People's Runway: How Colm Dillane Is Redefining NYFW</h1>
        <p class="meta">Published February 20, 2026 • 5 min read</p>

        <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1558618666-fcd25c85cd64?w=1200" alt="New York Fashion Week Street Style" class="featured-image">

        <p>NEW YORK — In an industry often criticized for its gatekeeping and exclusivity, Colm Dillane is taking a radical approach. Instead of showcasing his own new collection at New York Fashion Week this season, the KidSuper founder—the inaugural Brooklyn Arts Ambassador—gave his prestigious runway slot to five emerging designers from the borough.</p>

        <p>The result was "The People's Runway," a show that prioritized community over commerce and mentorship over marketability. And in doing so, Dillane may have just previewed the future of fashion.</p>

        <div class="quote">
            "I wanted to use this platform to open doors for voices that don't usually get heard on the CFDA calendar. This isn't about me—it's about the next generation of Brooklyn designers."
        </div>

        <h2>The Five Voices</h2>

        <p>Presented in partnership with Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, The People's Runway showcased five designers, each bringing their unique perspective to the runway:</p>

        <div class="designer-spotlight">
            <h3>Kent Anthony</h3>
            <p>Anthony debuted boxy jackets and sleek trousers rooted in both classical references and the vibrant energy of the borough. His work bridged traditional tailoring with streetwear sensibility—exactly what we've come to expect from Brooklyn's emerging talent.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="designer-spotlight">
            <h3>Shriya Myneni</h3>
            <p>Explored the ever-evolving nature of identity through her collection, creating pieces that challenged conventional notions of gender and cultural belonging. Myneni's work felt particularly timely in 2026's fashion landscape.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="designer-spotlight">
            <h3>Rojin Jung, Ahmirii Johnson & Daveed Baptiste</h3>
            <p>Each brought their distinct POV to the runway, representing the diversity of Brooklyn's creative community. From Jung's minimalist approach to Johnson's bold prints to Baptiste's architectural constructions, the show was a masterclass in emerging talent.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Why This Matters</h2>

        <p>Let's be real: New York Fashion Week has a credibility problem. For years, the schedule has been criticized for prioritizing celebrity fronts over actual design talent, and commercial viability over artistic vision. Shows have become Instagram backdrops rather than moments of genuine creative expression.</p>

        <p>KidSuper's approach cuts through that noise entirely. By using his CFTA calendar slot—the official New York Fashion Week schedule—to platform others, Dillane is making a statement about what fashion could be: a collaborative ecosystem rather than a competitive hierarchy.</p>

        <p>This isn't charity. It's strategy. Dillane built KidSuper on the premise that streetwear and high fashion can coexist, that art and commerce aren't mutually exclusive, and that authenticity matters more than prestige. The People's Runway extends that philosophy to the industry level.</p>

        <h2>Colm Dillane's Journey</h2>

        <p>If you're only now hearing about KidSuper, here's the cheat sheet: Dillane launched the brand in Brooklyn, gaining recognition for his bold graphics and community-first approach. His Paris Men's presentation in June 2025 solidified his status as a serious design talent—someone capable of holding his own on the international stage.</p>

        <p>But what sets Dillane apart isn't just his design sensibility (though the "simplexity" approach—maximalist prints with clean silhouettes—is genuinely compelling). It's his understanding that fashion operates in a cultural ecosystem. Designers don't exist in isolation; they're part of communities, cities, movements.</p>

        <p>By becoming Brooklyn's first Arts Ambassador and immediately using that platform to uplift others, Dillane is modeling a new kind of fashion leadership. One that prioritizes collective success over individual glory.</p>

        <h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>

        <p>The timing of The People's Runway feels particularly significant. As streetwear continues its conquest of high fashion—and as the lines between luxury and urban culture blur further—questions of authenticity and credit are becoming increasingly fraught. Who gets to call themselves a designer? Whose voices matter? Who gets the runway?</p>

        <p>Dillane's answer is refreshingly democratic: everyone. Or at least, everyone willing to put in the work.</p>

        <p>The People's Runway wasn't about lowering standards. The five designers showcased were genuinely talented, with work that held its own against established names. It was about expanding access—creating pathways into an industry that has historically been closed to outsiders.</p>

        <h2>What's Next</h2>

        <p>According to reports from Vogue, Dillane is already planning future installments of The People's Runway. And given his track record—KidSuper's Paris debut, the Brooklyn Arts Ambassadorship, this season's NYFW pivot—there's every reason to believe he'll deliver.</p>

        <p>For now, though, the message is clear: the future of fashion isn't about single visionary geniuses. It's about communities, ecosystems, and designers who understand that lifting others doesn't diminish your own light.</p>

        <h2>The Takeaway</h2>

        <p>In an era when fashion weeks are increasingly dominated by brand activations, influencer fronts, and commercial concerns, KidSuper's People's Runway was a reminder of what the runway can be: a platform for genuine creative voices, chosen not for their social media following but for their talent and vision.</p>

        <p>Colm Dillane didn't need to share his spotlight. He chose to. And in doing so, he may have just set a new standard for what fashion leadership looks like in 2026 and beyond.</p>
